<b><font size="6" color="#855f39">Hello Sir Vincent this is “Lei” writing po, not Aleina who’s always trying to maintain being a top student, not the girl who loves Mathematics, but just a student who had gotten attached to the adviser everyone calls “Papa Bear” because it’s true, Sir, you not only act as a Mathematics teacher to us or the other sections but also our second father in school. In all my years as a student, I have never gotten so attached to a teacher, especially an adviser I’m sure that many students also appreciate your kind and caring nature even when we are seen as the hardest section to teach in. Despite our infamous section you’ve still stayed as our adviser nonetheless. Thank you Sir for still being here with us from the first day to the last days.

I still can't believe po na its almost the end of the school year. It's funny how my first expectation of hearig that our advisor would be strict based on a gr12 student told me during enrollment would turn out to be the biggest lie I've ever heard. When the 1st classes arrived my expectationts dropped because when you came in and spoke so soft like you could never get mad, maybe sir you were shocked by how roudy the section that was given to you seemed, how loud suddenly everyone was.

One of my core memory is our section being said aloud as the finalist for the TVL strand. I'm sure my classmates were also happy and proud that our "infamous" section made it in, having to compete in the fiaals was something, a mixture of fear and excitement, the fear of messing up ad the excitement of getting to represent the strand again. Atleast we tried, we did not win it but we were all glad that it was over, now its just ones of Obadiahs one of many happy memories. Thank you Sir Vince for staying and watching over us, with youe guidance it made it a little easier to focus on what's infront of us. Thank you for being the loudest in the crowd to cheer us on, it meant alot that you watched us perform that day🫂 <br>

We had quite a love hate relationship planning our Year End Party, but again everything has positive sides. We all grew much closer and comfortable with one another, planning, buying the prizes and wrapping the prizes, we alll had moments during and when taking a break, talks and such. It was a little stressful but seeing ourclassmates and you sir, happy and contet was worth it because they were noisy in a good way.<br>

Update from your napaka cute at napaka ganda mopong officers🎀<br>
<br>
It's hard having responsibilities while dealing with the section, we too feel exhausted when it comes to warning them and fulfilling our duties, we manage them by helping one another out and brainstorming for a way to make the job less tiring. Inever expected that we three would also be top of the class, The three of us are always together po, pag nag aaral po for tests nag rreview po kami before it starts and napaka favorite po namin punuin yung board with solutions and equations lalo napo sa math, kahit po pag groupings kami kmai po nag ttulungan kahit iba po group namin, pag assignments po tulungan din, kahit po sa duties tulungan din po kami. pag alam po kami namay chance or oras para magtulungan kinukuha po namin, dahil pare-parehas po kaming gustong gusto na pumasa, why not mag hilahan po kami pataas. We assure po Sir Vince na we are doing fine po kasi hindi po namin pinapabayaan ang isa't isa.💗<br>
